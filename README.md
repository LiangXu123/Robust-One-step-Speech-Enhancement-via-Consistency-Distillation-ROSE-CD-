## Highlights

- A one-step consistency distillation method for real-time speech enhancement.
- Mitigates teacher bias via randomized training and time-domain auxiliary losses.
- Achieves 54× faster inference while surpassing the 30-step teacher model.
- Demonstrates strong generalization across out-of-domain and real-world scenarios.
